# Testing

The game was tested manually by running the program multiple times.

## Test Cases

| Test | What was tested | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Normal number input | Worked correctly |
| 2 | Correct guess | Game showed win message |
| 3 | Letters instead of numbers | Error message shown |
| 4 | Very large number | Counted as an attempt |
| 5 | Using all attempts | Game over message |

## Bug Found

At first, the program tried to convert any input into a number, which caused an error when letters were entered.

## Bug Fix

A check was added to make sure the input is a valid number before converting it.

## Notes

After fixing the bug, the game works as expected.
